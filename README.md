## ðŸ”§ Origin

Part of the broader **PUTMAN Modelâ„¢** for symbolic mapping and narrative cognition. Designed to capture **tone deviation**, **symbolic recursion**, and **emotional resonance** in ways both **computational and intuitive**.

If LLMs let AI speak *intelligently*, ToneSÂ¡gâ„¢ lets it speak *with feeling*.
